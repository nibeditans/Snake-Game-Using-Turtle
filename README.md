# Snake-Game-Using-Turtle

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen and eats randomly placed fruit to grow longer. The player's objective is to control the snake's movements to avoid collisions with the screen borders and the snake itself. The game ends if the snake collides with the borders or itself.

## Features
* Snake movement controlled by arrow keys.
* Randomly placed fruit for the snake to eat and grow.

* Game over screen with the final score.

## How to Play
* Run the Python script.
* Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
